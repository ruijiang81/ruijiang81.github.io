I am an Assistant Professor in Information Systems at [Naveen Jindal School of Management](https://jindal.utdallas.edu/), [UT Dallas](https://www.utdallas.edu/).
I received my PhD degree from [McCombs School of Business, UT Austin](https://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/). 
I received my master's degree in Statistics from [Univerisity of Michigan](https://umich.edu/), and bachelor's degree in Statistics from [USTC](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/). I previously worked at 
[Netflix Research](https://research.netflix.com/) (advised by [James Mclnerney](https://jamesmc.com/) and [Nathan Kallus](https://nathankallus.com/)), [Harvard University](https://www.hbs.edu/) (advised by [Himabindu Lakkaraju](https://himalakkaraju.github.io/)), [IBM Research](https://research.ibm.com) (advised by [Wei Sun](https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=us-sunw), [Max Biggs](https://maxbiggs91.github.io/mbiggs.github.io/index.html), and [Markus Ettl](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wfFaZFkAAAAJ&hl=en)), [Tencent](https://www.tencent.com/en-us/), and [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com).

# Research

<div class="grey-background">
My research focuses on advancing <span class="burntorange-text">human-centered machine learning</span>, with an emphasis on enhancing the <span class="burntorange-text">robustness</span>, <span class="burntorange-text">interpretability</span>, <span class="burntorange-text">adaptability</span>, and <span class="burntorange-text">fairness</span> of different kinds of ML/AI models, including foundational models. Many of my research aim to answer these questions:
<ol>
<li>How to develop algorithms that can better utilize human expertise to enhance machine learning systems?</li>
<li>How to design more effective/ethical human-AI systems and AI explanations?</li>
<li>How to assess individual preferences or algorithm performance in the presence of missing counterfactuals?</li>
</ol>

    I am looking for self-motivated undergraduate/graduate students who are interested in the broad area of human-centered ML/AI. Please send me an email with your CV and a brief description of your research interests if you are interested in working with me. For prospective PhD students, please apply to the <a href="https://jindal.utdallas.edu/phd-programs/management-science/information-systems/">IS PhD program</a> at UT Dallas. Please note that I am unable to respond to individual inquiries regarding admissions to masterâ€™s or PhD programs.</p>
