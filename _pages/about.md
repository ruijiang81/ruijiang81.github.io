I am currently a Ph.D. student at [McCombs School of Business](https://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/), [UT Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/). <br>
I received my bachelor's degree in Statistics at [School of the Gifted Young](https://en.scgy.ustc.edu.cn/), [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/) and master degree in Statistics at [Univerisity of Michigan](https://umich.edu/).
