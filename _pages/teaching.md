Instructor for MIS 301 - INTRODUCTION TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT - Spring 2022. 

# Course Overview 
Information technology (IT) has transformed all aspects of 21st century business and everyday 
life. New IT investments continue to be staggering. Worldwide, over $2.5 trillion is invested in 
IT. In the U.S., over 50% of capital expenditures are related to IT. IT has triggered new forms of 
organizations and business process innovation and impacted organizational structure, culture, 
politics, decision making, and society. IT is also transforming how physical products are 
designed, how services are bundled with products, and how individuals interact with businesses 
and with other individuals. A silent transformation of physical items is occurring as more and 
more products use embedded IT to improve customer experience and product performance. The 
pervasiveness of IT is expanding global trade and changing how and where work is performed.   
  
It is vital that future managers—in every area of business—have a working knowledge of 
modern IT, practical experience in its use, and management perspectives on how IT is used in 
organizations. 

MIS 301 will focus on three broad issues:  
 
(a) Using IT for strategic competitive advantage  
(b) IT core skills and management  
(c) IT at the intersection of functional business areas 
 
Topics covered include the IT ecosystem, using information systems (IS) for competitive 
advantage, databases, data communications, mobile telecommunications, business process 
management, and business intelligence. While students are introduced to the practical business 
use of hands-on technology (particularly Excel), the real value that McCombs majors gain from 
MIS 301 comes from understanding the strategic possibilities inherent at the intersection of 
business and technology.
