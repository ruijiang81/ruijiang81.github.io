I am an Assistant Professor in Information Systems at [Naveen Jindal School of Management](https://jindal.utdallas.edu/), [UT Dallas](https://www.utdallas.edu/).
I received my PhD degree from [McCombs School of Business, UT Austin](https://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/). 
I received my master's degree in Statistics from [Univerisity of Michigan](https://umich.edu/), and bachelor's degree in Statistics from [USTC](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/). I previously worked at 
[Netflix Research](https://research.netflix.com/) (advised by [James Mclnerney](https://jamesmc.com/) and [Nathan Kallus](https://nathankallus.com/)), [HBS](https://www.hbs.edu/) (advised by [Himabindu Lakkaraju](https://himalakkaraju.github.io/)), [IBM Research](https://research.ibm.com) (advised by [Wei Sun](https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=us-sunw), [Max Biggs](https://maxbiggs91.github.io/mbiggs.github.io/index.html), and [Markus Ettl](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wfFaZFkAAAAJ&hl=en)), [Tencent](https://www.tencent.com/en-us/), and [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com).

# Research
My research is centered around <b>Human-Centered Machine Learning</b>. Specifically, I aim to enhance ML/AI algorithms in areas such as 
Human-AI Systems, Active Learning, Causal ML/RL, GenAI/LLM, and Explainable AI. Many of my research aim to answer these questions:

1. How to develop algorithms that can better utilize human expertise to enhance machine learning systems? [1,6,7,8,11,12,13,14]
2. How to design better human-AI systems and comprehend their sociotechnical implications? [1,3,6,12,13]
3. How to assess individual preference or algorithm performance in the presence of missing counterfactuals? [2,5,12,13,15,16]
4. How to improve the interpretability, fairness, and accountability of ML models? [3,4,9,13]
